Set 2

1. It determines the length of each side of the box - how far the bug will move before it turns.
2. The steps variable counts the amount of steps it has been before it has to turn.
3. Because when the boxbug turns it must make a 90 degree angle, and each turn only goes 45 degrees.
4. Because BoxBug extends bug and it can call on the public methods in bug.
5. Yes, unless it runs into something.
6. No because it has a set sidelength, and will always change 90 degrees so it just runs an infinite box.
7. After it turns.
